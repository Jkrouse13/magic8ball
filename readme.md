# Magic 8-ball
In this activity we will be creating a magic 8 ball using Ruby.

By the end of the activity your magic 8 ball program should be able to accomplish the following:

- Prompt a user to ask a question
- Randomly select a predefined answer
- Show the user the answer to their question

# Pre defined answers
- It is certain
- It is decidedly so
- Without a doubt
- Yes definitely
- You may rely on it
- As I see it, yes
- Most likely
- Outlook good
- Yes
- Signs point to yes
- Reply hazy try again
- Ask again later
- Better not tell you now
- Cannot predict now
- Concentrate and ask again
- Don't count on it
- Jon is the best
- My reply is no
- My sources say no
- Outlook not so good
- Very doubtful

# Sample?!?
Picking a random item from a collection is not incredibly difficult in Ruby. An array has a [].sample method that will return a random item from your array. See this stack overflow answer for a demonstration  -- https://newline.theironyard.com/courses/4/activities/214
